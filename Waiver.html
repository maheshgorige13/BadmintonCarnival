                        that
                        no other evidence shall be used or admitted to alter or explain the terms of this agreement, but
                        that it will be
                        interpreted based on the language in accordance with the purposes for which it is entered into.

                        term, condition, phrase or portion of this agreement shall be determined to be unlawful or
                        otherwise unenforceable,
                        the remainder of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect. If a court should find
                        that any provision of
